## Solution

The goal in the initial creation of this app is to have a working prototype of the concept. In this project we were able to establish the structure of components in React, have the Firebase authentication groundwork, create the base for Mongo, and be able to call one of the Job Search API's.

## Technologies Used

- Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
- Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
- Boostrap (CSS Library)
- React
- MDBReact (React Framework)
- JavaScript (Programming Language)
- Google Firebase (Database/ Authentication)
- MongoDB (Database)
- FontAwesome (Icon Library)
- USA JOB API (Job Search API: https://developer.usajobs.gov)

## Scale & Future Improvements

The improvements that we'd make is add some of the backlog items, such as adding and tracking a job you've applied to. From here, you can get notifications on things to do to improve your job search. Additionally, we'd like to have our own job search and creation engine, while also having other jobs being aggregated via a web scraper.
